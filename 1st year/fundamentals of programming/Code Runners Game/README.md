# ðŸŽ² Code Runners
* console-based version of the game, in which the player must determine the value of a pseudo-random number generated by the computer. 
----  
## How to play: 

* #### when a new game is started, the computer generates a four digit random secret number; the first digit is non-zero and all digits are distinct (e.g. `1234`, `1984`, `1980`, `1024`)

* #### for each round, the player must enter a four digit number.    
     ##### - if the number is not valid (the corect criteria is not met, that is), the game is over and the computer wins.  
     ##### - if the number is incorrect, the computer informs the player about the number of codes and the number of runners. (codes = correct digits in correct positions, runners = correct digits in incorrect positions)  
     ##### - if the number is correct, the game is over and the player wins.  

* #### `8086` is a cheat code that when entered as a guess, causes the computer to reveal the number it selected (the game otherwise continues as usual)  
    
* #### if the player didn't already win, the game ends after being played for more than 60 seconds.
